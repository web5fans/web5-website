title: Nostr Integration
description: Guidelines for integrating Nostr protocol with Web5 applications
---

[Nostr](https://nostr.com/) is a decentralized protocol for social networking that uses public-key cryptography for identity and message signing.
Integrating Nostr with Web5 applications allows users to leverage their `did:ckb` identities for secure and verifiable interactions on Nostr-based platforms.

[WIP-04](https://github.com/web5fans/web5-wips/blob/master/04.md) defines a method for storing Nostr public keys and relays in the `did:ckb` identities while maintaining the compatibility for AT Protocol and W3C DID standards.

A `did:ckb` Metadata example with both AT Protocol and Nostr information:

```json
{
  "verificationMethods": {
    "atproto": "did:key:zSigningKey",
    "nostr": "ce6232feaec4e6d01a4e00daa3648030c42017bdf589e34b53744fc49c5cba8a"
  },
  "alsoKnownAs": ["at://alice.test", "nostr://alice@example.com"],
  "services": {
    "atproto_pds": {
      "type": "AtprotoPersonalDataServer",
      "endpoint": "<https://example.test>"
    },
    "nostr_relay": {
      "type": "NostrRelay",
      "endpoint": "wss://relay.damus.io,wss://nostr.fmt.wiz.biz,wss://relay.nostr.band"
    }
  }
}
```

To integrate `did:ckb` in Nostr clients, one can resolve the Nostr public key and relay information from the DID Document associated with the user's `did:ckb` identifier.
After the resolve, one can use them for authentication and messaging on Nostr networks, just like the traditional workflows in building Nostr applications.

Note that in this way, Nostr users don't need to leveraging relay discover techniques like outbox model and [NIP-65](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/65.md).
