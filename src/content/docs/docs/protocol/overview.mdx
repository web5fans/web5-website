title: Web5 Protocol Overview
description: An overview of the Web5 protocol components and architecture
---

The protocol refers to the [tech stack](/docs/#the-tech-stack) that underpins Web5 applications.
As nowadays the [web5.fans](https://web5.fans) is still exploring Web5 at an early stage, the protocol is continuously evolving. 
A lot of components are not stable and subject to change in the full tech stack.
This page provides a high-level overview of the core components of the Web5 protocol. It might be updated as the protocol evolves.

## Core Components

The web5 protocol consists of two main layers: Web5/3 and Web5/2. The high-level guidance for each layer is [explained here](/docs/#the-idea) and as follows:

**1. Web5/3**

should be open, verifiable, and censorship-resistant systems, such as L1 chains or L2 (rollups, channels) that can provide security and censorship resistance matching L1. 

It trades costs for high security and censorship resistance.

**2. Web5/2**

is not censorship-resistant but can still achieve openness and verifiability. 

Openness means open-source code, migratable private data, accessible and replicable public data.

Verifiability means any node or client can locally verify requests/transactions/data related to itself are correct, such as nostr, atproto, DHT, semi-centralized/permissioned blockchains.

### Web5/3

#### On-chain Identifiers (DIDs)

DID gives users a self-sovereign digital identity that they fully own and control.
The Web5 expects on-chain DIDs that are compatible with W3C DID standards to be the root of trust for users' identities.

The first on-chain DID method in the Web5 ecosystem is [`did:ckb`](/docs/protocol/did-ckb), which leverages the Nervos CKB blockchain to provide a secure and censorship-resistant identity layer.

With CKB's unique cell model and interoperability from [RGB++ protocol](https://www.rgbppfans.com/), `did:ckb` also enables users to hold their identities from Bitcoin, further enhancing security and decentralization.

#### Assets and Settlement Layer

Web5/3 requires a secure and verifiable assets and settlement layer to support decentralized applications.

One can mint, transfer, exchange and burn digital assets includes [Fungible Token](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/assets-token-standards/xudt) and [Non-Fungible Token](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/assets-token-standards/spore-protocol) on CKB in their Web5 applications. Since CKB has great interoperability with Bitcoin and other blockchains, 
such assets can also flow across different blockchains securely with the help of RGB++ protocol and bridging solutions.

CKB is general verification layer, it also serves as the settlement layer for Web5 applications, for example, one can build decentralized polling or [voting](https://github.com/web5fans/ckb-dao-vote) components on top of CKB and integrate those components in the web5 applications.

#### Payment Network

[Fiber Network](https://fiber.world/) is a channel network based on CKB.
It can be used as the payment network to support micro-payments for off-chain, high-throughput usage in the web5 applications.

### Web5/2

#### Personal Data Servers (PDS)

Personal Data Servers (PDS) are off-chain components that allow users to manage their own data and facilitate interactions with on-chain identities. 

It is first introduced by the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) and serves as a pure web 2 architecture. By integrate PDS into the web5 tech stack, users can enjoy a better user experience while still owning their identities and opening possibilities to interact with web5/3 components.

AT Protocol also provides a full design around PDS, making it the ideal component to build complex applications such as social networks in the web5 ecosystem.

#### Nostr Protocol

[Nostr](https://nostr.com/) defines a simple architecture of clients and servers that spread information freely. It is incomplete but more flexible compared to AT Protocol. 

Under some specific scenarios, Nostr is the ideal choices to be used as the off-chain messaging component in Web5 applications.
