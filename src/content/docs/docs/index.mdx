description: Build decentralized applications with Web5. Own your data, identity, and future.
---

Web5 is a decentralized web platform that lets you build applications where users truly own their data and identity. No more centralized servers controlling your information—with Web5, the power belongs to the people.

## What is Web5?

Web5 combines the best of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, bringing decentralized identity and data storage to the web without requiring blockchain knowledge. It's designed to be developer-friendly and user-centric.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Create and manage your own identity without relying on centralized authorities
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Prove attributes about yourself without exposing unnecessary information
- **Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)**: Store and manage your data across multiple nodes you control
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users own and control their digital identity and data

## Why Web5?

The current web is broken. Your data is scattered across countless platforms, locked in corporate silos. Web5 fixes this by:

1. **Data Ownership**: You control where your data lives and who can access it
2. **Portable Identity**: One identity works across all applications
3. **Privacy First**: Share only what you choose to share
4. **Interoperability**: Your data works seamlessly across different applications
