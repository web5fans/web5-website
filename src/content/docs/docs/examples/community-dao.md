The [CKB Community Fund DAO 1.1](https://github.com/ccf-dao1-1) is a Web5-based governance platform for the CKB Community Fund DAO 1.1 proposal team. It aims to drive innovation in the CKB ecosystem through transparent funding and governance.

Users can sign in using `did:ckb`, submit proposals, and vote on them. The platform uses the AT Protocol to store proposal data and user activities, while integrating a voting smart contract on the CKB blockchain to ensure secure and transparent funding and governance.
