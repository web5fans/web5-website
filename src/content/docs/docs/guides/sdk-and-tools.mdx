description: Explore the SDKs and tools available for building with Web5.

The web5 tech stack is still at an early stage. This page is an effort to document and share the SDKs and tools available for building decentralized applications with Web5.

## SDKs

- [@ckb-ccc/did-ckb](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/ccc/pull/337): A JavaScript SDK for creating, managing, and resolving CKB DIDs.
- [rsky](https://github.com/web5fans/rsky): A Rust SDK for building Web5 PDS, providing tools and libraries to interact with decentralized identities and data storage.

## Infra Tools

- [web5-indexer](https://github.com/web5fans/web5-indexer): a indexer for CKB DIDs that follow every did transaction on CKB blockchain and indexing every did record through path `<server url>\{:did}`.

More tools and SDKs will be added here as the ecosystem grows. Stay tuned for updates!
