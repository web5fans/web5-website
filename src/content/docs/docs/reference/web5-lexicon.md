title: Web5 Lexicon
description: Lexicon spec for web5
---

This page records the web5 related lexicon that should be followed by client and server to be integrated into the web5 tech stack. The purpose is to add an _optional_ Web5-aware layer to the AT Protocol Personal-Data-Server (PDS) surface by re-using the existing XRPC transport and Lexicon schema language.

All lexicon schemas are pure Lexicon 1 JSON and live under the NSID authority `fans.web5.ckb.*`. It shall be noted that most of the lexicons are still under draft proposing. Feel free to join in the discussion in the [Pull requests](https://github.com/web5fans/web5-wips/blob/wip-06/06.md) of the WIPs.

## did:ckb PDS Extension Lexicon

This defines the standard for `did:ckb` PDS extension lexicon. It introduces:

- a CKB-style account-flow (Nervos-CKB address, secp256k1 signature over repo root),
- pre-flight signing steps so wallets can prompt users once and re-use the signature for the actual write,
- a small set of index helpers for light-weight queries that do not require repository traversal.

All new schemas are published and MUST be resolved under the NSID authority `fans.web5.ckb.*` and can be imported side-by-side with the official `com.atproto.*` lexicons.

### Design Goals

1. **Wallet-native UX** – the user sees only one signing prompt per logical action.
2. **Minimal delta** – no forks inside repo data-structures; everything is ordinary AT-Protocol records.
3. **Incremental adoption** – a PDS that does not understand these NSIDs can safely ignore them; clients that do can speak them with the supported PDS. A future-proof mechanism can be added to allow the PDS advertises the capability via `fans.web5.ckb` in `.well-known/supported-lexicon`, etc.

### Lexicon Overview

| File                    | Purpose                                                           | XRPC Type |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `preCreateAccount.json` | returns the unsigned repo root that must be signed by the CKB key | procedure |
| `createAccount.json`    | finalises account creation with the signed payload                | procedure |
| `preDirectWrites.json`  | returns the unsigned commit for a batch write                     | procedure |
| `directWrites.json`     | applies the batch once the commit is signed                       | procedure |
| `preIndexAction.json`   | returns the challenge string for login / delete-account           | procedure |
| `indexAction.json`      | verifies the signed challenge and performs the action             | procedure |
| `indexQuery.json`       | cheap read-only helpers (counters, DID lookups, …)                | query     |
| `defs.json`             | shared shapes (`signedRoot`, etc.)                                | —         |

Machine-readable schemas live in [`assets/lexicon/ckb/`](assets/lexicon/ckb). Human-readable examples and sequence diagrams will be added in a future revision.

## CKB-Specific Fields

- `ckbAddr` – Nervos-CKB short-address (bech32m, testnet/mainnet prefix).
- `signedBytes` – secp256k1 personal-message signature (base64, 65-bytes, recoverable).
- `signingKey` – did:key string that must resolve to the same secp256k1 pubkey that signed `signedBytes`.

## Security Considerations

- The PDS **must** verify that `ckbAddr` matches the recovered pubkey before persisting any repo root.
- Challenge messages **must** include the PDS origin to avoid cross-service replay.
- Clients **should** pin the PDS TLS certificate when obtaining the challenge to prevent MitM downgrade.

## Backwards Compatibility

None of the new procedures collide with existing `com.atproto.*` NSIDs. A legacy PDS returns status 501 for unknown methods; clients fall back to standard flows.

## Reference Implementation

A reference Rust SDK implementation is tracked in [web5-rsky](https://github.com/web5fans/rsky/tree/main/rsky-lexicon). Typescript SDK and PDS plugin might be added later.
